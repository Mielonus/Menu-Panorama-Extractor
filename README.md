# Menu Panorama Extractor by Mielon
A program that allows the extraction of the panorama files from Minecraft's main menu and automatically creates a resource pack containing it. It works from Minecraft version 1.14+.

The program is very basic and may have bugs or not respond at times. However, it's good enough for quickly extracting the panorama files.

# Known Issues:

- The program sometimes freezes after creating the resource pack.
- The program still creates the resource pack even if it doesn't find any panorama files.
